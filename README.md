# IoMBian Tunnels Handler

This service creates SSH tunnels and, using the [IoMBian Configurator platform](https://iombian-configurator.web.app/), allows the device to be controlled and managed remotely, from outside the local network.

> Warning: the service assumes that the boringproxy binary file is properly installed and available in one of the most common binary folders (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin).
